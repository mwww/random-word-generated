# Random-Word-Generated

## wtf is this?

this is the result of my [random word generator.](https://github.com/MWWW/go-random-word-generator)


## How to use?

all words here are clustered by a specific requairenments.
for example, if you want word with 3 letters in it, consised of alphanumeric, readable, and have a minimum of 2 unique char (e.g. "egg"), than you'll choose `2-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-true-2`

## FAQ (I think...)

Q: why there aren't any "unreadable" word?
A: is is still called word if it isn't readable?

Q: why is it divided into parts?
A: because it is faster to that way(you can regenerate i using my [generator](https://github.com/MWWW/go-random-word-generator) if you want.)
